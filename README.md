# Poster
These are the files for my poster presentation used for 2018 UT Liberal Arts Research Week Poster Presentation.

This repository has two versions: R version (without panel regression) and STATA version (with panel regression).

## Research Question
Questioning whether there is a significant relationship between GDP per Capita growth and democracy stock (defined by Gerring et al.'s 2005 article), with an interaction effect of regime types including dominant party system, defined by Kenneth Greene's 2009 writing "Why Dominant Parties Lose". This poster used a panel data ananlysis with robust standard errors, yet it concluded that there is no significant relationship between GDP per Capita and democracy stock with an interaction of regime types.
